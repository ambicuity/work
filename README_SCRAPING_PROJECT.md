- **`demo_with_mock_data.py`** - Demonstration script with realistic mock data (used due to network limitations)
- **`validate_data.py`** - Data validation and format checking script

### 2. Output Files

## Data Cleaning Applied

1. **Text Normalization**: Removed extra whitespace and special characters
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate organizations based on name
3. **Email Validation**: Extracted valid email addresses using regex patterns
4. **Phone Formatting**: Standardized phone number formats
5. **URL Validation**: Ensured proper URL formatting for social media links
6. **Category Assignment**: Automatically categorized organizations based on keywords

## Technical Implementation

### Scraping Strategy
The scraper uses multiple strategies to extract organization data:

1. **Structured Data Detection**: Looks for common HTML patterns like lists, tables, and cards
2. **Text Pattern Matching**: Uses regex to identify organization names, emails, and phone numbers
3. **Content Analysis**: Analyzes text content to determine organization categories
4. **Fallback Methods**: Employs alternative extraction methods when structured data isn't available

### Error Handling
- Network timeouts and connection errors are handled gracefully
- Invalid URLs are skipped with appropriate logging
- Partial data extraction continues even if some fields are missing

### Data Validation
- Column format validation against Rice University reference format
- Data quality checks for completeness and consistency
- Duplicate detection and removal

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Scraper (with network access)
```bash
python3 scrape_universities_91_100.py
```

### Running the Demo (without network access)
```bash
python3 demo_with_mock_data.py
```

### Validating the Data
```bash
python3 validate_data.py
```
